This project is a console-based Learning Management System (LMS) developed using the C++ programming language. The purpose of this project is to simulate a basic university-level LMS where different users such as Admins, Teachers, and Students can interact with courses and assignments. The system runs completely in the terminal and uses a menu-driven approach, making it easy to understand and operate.

The LMS follows object-oriented programming concepts. Different classes are created to represent real-world entities such as users, courses, and assignments. The project is designed for beginners, so it avoids complex data structures like vectors or advanced libraries and instead uses simple arrays and functions.

The Admin role is responsible for managing the system. An Admin can enroll new students and teachers into the LMS. The Admin can also view the list of all enrolled students and teachers. Student and teacher data is stored using file handling, so the information is saved even after the program is closed and reopened.

Teachers in the system can create courses and manage assignments for those courses. A teacher can add assignments, view them, and grade assignments submitted by students. This allows teachers to perform basic academic management tasks within the LMS.

Students can enroll in available courses offered by teachers. After enrolling, students can view their courses, see available assignments, and submit their work. Once an assignment is graded by the teacher, the student can also view the marks. This simulates the basic workflow of a real LMS.

The project makes use of several important C++ concepts such as classes and objects, inheritance, file handling using ifstream and ofstream, arrays, and functions. The menu-based system helps users navigate easily between different options. Overall, this LMS project is a good learning example for understanding object-oriented programming and basic system design in C++.
